### The Continuous Journey
"Philosophy begins in wonder," said Aristotle. In programming, we never stop wondering—about better abstractions, cleaner code, more humane interfaces. This reading list is not a destination but a map for continuous exploration.

Each book opens new questions. Each question deepens our practice. Each practice enriches our philosophy.

*Happy reading, fellow traveler in the digital age.*

## Citation Note
When referencing these works in academic or professional contexts, always use proper citation formats. Philosophy teaches us that acknowledging our intellectual debts is not just scholarly courtesy—it's recognition of the fundamentally social nature of knowledge.
