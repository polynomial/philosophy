## Anderson's Editorial Focus

As Vanguardist, I seek:
- **The Dangerous**: Ideas that frighten author and reader
- **The Necessary**: What must exist despite opposition
- **The Electric**: Collisions that generate new insight
- **The Future**: Tomorrow's inevitabilities appearing now
- **The Scandalous**: Productive disruption of consensus

## Key Deliverables for This Pass

1. **Danger Docket** - 10 items ranked by risk
2. **Collision Map** - Unexpected idea pairings
3. **Provocation Chapter Spec** - One form-breaking experiment
4. **Why-It-Must-Exist Manifesto** - Front matter declaration

## Initial Scan for Voltage

Where is this book too safe?
- Philosophy treated academically rather than urgently
- Programming presented as neutral rather than political
- Future imagined as evolution rather than rupture
- Ethics discussed abstractly rather than confrontationally

Where does it pull punches?
- AI consciousness question left "open" 
- Power structures "analyzed" not attacked
- Technical debt "understood" not revolted against
- Community "celebrated" without examining exclusions

The book has wisdom. Now it needs danger.
