## Campbell's Editorial Focus

As Systems Provost, I examine this philosophical treatise through the lens of:
- **Testability**: Can claims be verified or falsified?
- **Mechanisms**: What causes lead to what effects?
- **Consequences**: What second and third-order effects follow?
- **Constraints**: What limits and trade-offs exist?
- **Failure Modes**: How might arguments break down?

## Key Deliverables for This Pass

1. **What-If Cascade Sheets** - One per major thesis
2. **Red-Team Chapter** - The strongest counter-argument  
3. **Engineering Notes** - Constraints and failure modes throughout
4. **Failure Ledger** - Tracking improved claims

## Initial Assessment

This treatise makes numerous philosophical claims about programming that need:
- Operational definitions
- Testable implications  
- Acknowledged limitations
- Concrete mechanisms

The challenge: Preserve philosophical depth while adding scientific rigor.
