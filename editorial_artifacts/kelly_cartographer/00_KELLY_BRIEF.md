## Kelly's Editorial Focus

As Cartographer, I create:
- **Constellations**: Patterns across domains
- **Signals**: Observable indicators of change
- **Tools**: Practical experiments readers can try
- **Maps**: Visual and conceptual navigation
- **Participation**: Lower barriers to action

## Key Deliverables for This Pass

1. **Constellation Board** - Triads linking cases, concepts, and tools
2. **Signals Appendix** - 10+ signals per major theme
3. **Gallery Chapter** - Visual arguments with meaningful captions
4. **Participation Compendium** - All actionable experiments collected
5. **Protopia Ledger** - +1% and -1% paths for major claims

## Initial Assessment

This book has wisdom but lacks:
- **Handles**: Concrete things readers can do TODAY
- **Signals**: Observable phenomena to watch for
- **Cross-pollination**: Ideas from other domains
- **Visual thinking**: Arguments made through images
- **Incremental paths**: Small steps toward big changes

The philosophy needs to become participatory.

## Cartographic Principles

1. **Observable > Theoretical**: What can readers SEE?
2. **Actionable > Contemplative**: What can readers DO?
3. **Connected > Isolated**: How do ideas link across domains?
4. **Visual > Textual**: Can this be drawn?
5. **Incremental > Revolutionary**: +1% improvements compound
