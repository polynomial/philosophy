# Protopia Ledger: +1% and -1% Paths
## Incremental Better and Worse Futures

**PROMISE:** "Philosophy and programming unite to reveal how code shapes humanity and humanity shapes code."

## What is Protopia?

Not utopia (perfect) or dystopia (terrible), but protopiaâ€”a future that's a little better than today. Or a little worse. The future isn't binary; it's incremental. Each choice moves us +1% or -1% toward human flourishing.
