## Lish's Editorial Focus

As Stylist, I seek:
- **Compression**: Maximum meaning in minimum words
- **Rhythm**: Sentences that swing and pulse
- **Concrete**: Images over abstractions
- **Heat**: Emotional voltage in prose
- **Silence**: What's unsaid speaks loudest

## Key Deliverables for This Pass

1. **Line-Edit Packet** - Before/after spreads showing transformations
2. **Compression Chapter** - One chapter rewritten with ≤12-word sentences
3. **Hedge Inventory** - All hedges found and eliminated
4. **Cadence Map** - Rhythm analysis of hinge chapters

---

## Initial Diagnosis

This manuscript suffers from:
- Academic bloat ("phenomenological", "ontological")
- Hedge addiction ("perhaps", "seems", "might")
- Explanation excess (saying what could be shown)
- Rhythm deafness (same sentence length throughout)
- Abstract fog (concepts without images)

The ideas have power. The prose needs surgery.

## Surgical Principles

1. **First sentence guillotine** - Most chapters don't start where they start
2. **Last sentence guillotine** - Most chapters don't end where they end
3. **Hedge removal** - Uncertainty weakens; commit or cut
4. **Verb activation** - Is/are/was/were → action
5. **Noun precision** - Thing/stuff/data → specifics
6. **Rhythm variation** - Long. Short. Medium with subclauses. Staccato.
