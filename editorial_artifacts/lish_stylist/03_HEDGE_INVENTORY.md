# Hedge Inventory: Documenting and Eliminating Uncertainty
## A Catalog of Cowardice

**PROMISE:** "Philosophy and programming unite to reveal how code shapes humanity and humanity shapes code."

## The Hedge Hunter's Guide

Hedges are linguistic cowardice. They protect the writer, not the reader. Every hedge says: "Don't blame me if this is wrong." Every hedge weakens the punch.

## Common Hedges Found (Frequency per Chapter)

### Tier 1: The Deadly Hedges (Kill on Sight)
- **"perhaps"** - 3-5 per chapter
- **"seems/seemed"** - 4-6 per chapter  
- **"might/may"** - 5-8 per chapter
- **"arguably"** - 2-3 per chapter
- **"in some sense"** - 2-4 per chapter
- **"somewhat"** - 3-4 per chapter
- **"rather"** - 4-5 per chapter
- **"quite"** - 2-3 per chapter

### Tier 2: The Sneaky Hedges
- **"often"** (when meaning "sometimes")
- **"typically"** (protecting against edge cases)
- **"generally"** (fear of counterexamples)
- **"usually"** (avoiding commitment)
- **"mostly"** (hedging the hedge)
- **"tends to"** (correlation cowardice)
- **"can be seen as"** (perspective paralysis)
- **"could be argued"** (argument avoidance)

### Tier 3: The Academic Hedges
- **"it would appear that"**
- **"one might suggest"**
- **"it is possible that"**
- **"this may indicate"**
- **"evidence suggests"** (when evidence shows)
- **"some would argue"** (whose argument is it?)
- **"in certain contexts"** (which contexts?)
- **"to some extent"** (what extent?)

## Replacement Strategies

### Strategy 1: Delete
**Before:** "This is perhaps the most important principle."
**After:** "This is the most important principle."
**Better:** "This principle matters most."

### Strategy 2: Commit
**Before:** "It seems that programmers experience flow states."
**After:** "Programmers experience flow states."
**Better:** "Programmers enter flow states."

### Strategy 3: Specify
**Before:** "This might cause problems in some cases."
**After:** "This causes problems when X exceeds Y."
**Better:** "When X exceeds Y, this breaks."

### Strategy 4: Evidence
**Before:** "Studies suggest that pair programming works."
**After:** "Three studies show pair programming reduces bugs 40%."
**Better:** "Pair programming cuts bugs 40% (Chen 2019, Smith 2020, Lee 2021)."

### Strategy 5: Own It
**Before:** "One could argue that code is literature."
**After:** "I argue that code is literature."
**Better:** "Code is literature."

## Hedge Removal Examples from Actual Text

### Example 1 (Ch. 3)
**Before:** "This neurochemical cocktail is perhaps why programming can feel somewhat transcendent, possibly why hours might pass without notice."

**After:** "This neurochemical cocktail explains programming's transcendence—why hours vanish."

**Hedges removed:** perhaps, somewhat, possibly, might (4)

### Example 2 (Ch. 21)
**Before:** "Code seems to exist simultaneously in what might be called multiple ontological realms, arguably challenging our rather simple notions of being."

**After:** "Code exists simultaneously in multiple realities, shattering our simple notions of being."

**Hedges removed:** seems, might be called, arguably, rather (4)

### Example 3 (Ch. 11)
**Before:** "This could be seen as a form of what Sartre perhaps meant by bad faith—a kind of self-deception that might allow us to avoid facing certain uncomfortable truths."

**After:** "This is Sartre's bad faith—self-deception to avoid uncomfortable truths."

**Hedges removed:** could be seen as, perhaps, kind of, might, certain (5)

## Special Cases: When Hedges Stay

### Legitimate Uncertainty
**Keep:** "Whether machines can truly think remains unknown."
**Why:** Genuine philosophical openness

### Actual Qualification  
**Keep:** "In quantum computing contexts, this changes."
**Why:** Specific limitation, not general cowardice

### Rhetorical Effect
**Keep:** "Perhaps you've felt this too—the moment when..."
**Why:** Creates intimacy, not avoiding commitment

## The Psychology of Hedging

Why do we hedge? Fear:
- Fear of being wrong
- Fear of criticism  
- Fear of commitment
- Fear of clarity
- Fear of strength

Every hedge is a small apology for having an opinion.

## The Hedge-Free Manifesto

From now on:
1. **Say what you mean**
2. **Mean what you say**
3. **Stand behind it**
4. **Let critics criticize**
5. **Be wrong boldly**

Better to be clearly wrong than vaguely right.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Search and Destroy
- Global find/replace for Tier 1 hedges
- Manual review for context
- Delete or replace each instance

### Phase 2: Sentence Surgery
- Rewrite hedge-heavy sentences entirely
- Focus on active voice and concrete claims
- Test reading aloud for confidence

### Phase 3: Final Sweep
- Read checking only for hedges
- Mark any remaining for review
- Justify or remove final instances

## Sample Hedge-Free Paragraph

**Before:**
"It might be argued that programming perhaps represents a somewhat unique form of human expression, possibly combining what could be seen as both analytical and creative aspects in ways that might challenge our rather traditional distinctions."

**After:**
"Programming fuses analysis and creation. It shatters traditional distinctions. Code is thought made real."

**Word count:** 32 → 14
**Hedges removed:** 7 → 0
**Impact:** 100% → 1000%
