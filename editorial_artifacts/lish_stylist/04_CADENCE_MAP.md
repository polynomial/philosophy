## Global Rhythm Principles

### 1. **The Breathing Pattern**
After 2-3 long sentences, insert short. Reader needs air.

### 2. **The Question Placement**
Questions after statements. Never consecutive questions (except for effect).

### 3. **The Fragment Power**
Fragments for emphasis only. One per paragraph maximum.

### 4. **The Cascade**
Long → Medium → Short → Fragment = Emphasis
Short → Short → Short → Long = Surprise

### 5. **The Paragraph Music**
Each paragraph needs:
- Opening note (usually medium)
- Development (varied)
- Resolution (usually short)

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Read Aloud Test**
If you can't read it aloud in one breath, it's too long.

2. **Rhythm Check**
Mark S/M/L/XL for each sentence. Look for patterns. Break patterns.

3. **Breath Points**
Mark where readers naturally pause. Usually after short sentences or before questions.

4. **Emotional Mapping**
High emotion = shorter sentences
Complex thought = longer sentences
Revelation = fragments

5. **The 2-20-2 Rule**
No more than 2 extra-long sentences without break
Aim for 20% short sentences minimum
At least 2 breath points per paragraph

## The Cadence Effect

Good rhythm makes ideas inevitable. The reader doesn't just understand—they feel the truth in their breathing. Philosophy becomes physical.

Bad rhythm makes brilliant ideas boring. The reader understands but doesn't care. Philosophy remains abstract.

Rhythm is thought. Cut to the beat.
