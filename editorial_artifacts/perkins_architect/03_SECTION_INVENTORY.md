## Summary Statistics
- **Total Chapters:** 40 + 4 appendices
- **Keep:** 44 (100%)
- **Cut:** 0
- **Park:** 0

## Courageous Cuts Considered
1. ~~Merge Chs 4 & 32 (Aesthetics/Rhythm)~~ - Rejected: Different stages of journey
2. ~~Cut Ch 9 (10x Developer Myth)~~ - Rejected: Important cultural critique
3. ~~Compress Vol 4 (Ethics) to 3 chapters~~ - Rejected: Each ethical framework essential

## Rationale for No Cuts
This comprehensive treatise achieves remarkable efficiency—each chapter serves the Promise and advances toward key hinges. The philosophical journey requires all stages for full transformation from "Hello World" to legacy consciousness. Any cuts would create gaps in the reader's development.

## Recommended Reordering
None. The current order follows optimal philosophical progression: phenomenology → social → existential → ethical → metaphysical → psychological → poetic → future. Each volume prepares necessary ground for the next.
