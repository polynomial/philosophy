**Strengths:** Mirrors how programmers actually develop, recursive deepening, innovative
**Weaknesses:** Requires explanation, might confuse readers expecting linear progression

## Recommendation

**Stick with Version A (Conservative)** for the following reasons:

1. **Philosophical Integrity**: The current structure follows natural philosophical development from self → other → world → future

2. **Educational Value**: Readers build conceptual frameworks before applying them

3. **Narrative Arc**: The seven hinges work perfectly with current order

4. **Market Positioning**: Serious philosophical work benefits from traditional structure

5. **Reader Journey**: Current order creates optimal transformation

However, **Version B (Bold)** could work as a "Reader's Guide" in the introduction, showing how different readers might navigate based on their immediate needs.

**Version C (Experimental)** is intellectually interesting but too risky for a comprehensive treatise. Could inspire a future companion volume: "Seven Spirals: A Recursive Guide to Programming Philosophy."

*The conservative structure isn't playing it safe—it's honoring the philosophical journey the content demands.*
